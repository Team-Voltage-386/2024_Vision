# 2024_Vision
Everything to do with vision processing. To figure out how the limelight works and turn it. Eventually the results will be included in the 2024 robot repo.

This project was an exploration in using cameras. Specifically, we explored how to subscribe to multiple cameras mounted on the demo-board and switch between them as seamlessly as possible.
